Due to the 2020 pandemic, I could no longer continue in collegue studying Computer Science, so I had to continue my learning  as a programmer with free resources on the internet.

 **I'm currently building projects to show in my portfolio.** My professional goal is to be a high level Full Stack MERN Developer  and then jump to mobile apps development with React Native.

Skills: HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap / JavaScript / Git 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
